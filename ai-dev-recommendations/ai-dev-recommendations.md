Has anybody ever exported a task list from AugmentCode to Markdown(md) format, committed it to a branch and created a Pull Request, and had CodeRabbit review your task list, make the edits via task manager, and reimport the new master list?

Anybody ever review a LICENSE file in Github for a private project using a CodeRabbit PR Review?

Has anybody ever used a public GitHub repo for Terms of Service and Privacy policy so users can see diffs and dates?

Anybody ever successfully create a GitHub issue using CodeRabbit?

Setup RAG Retrieval Augmented Generation using Ollama or equivalent ai and database and deployed that to a GPU host like Vast.ai?

If so, I'd like to chat. Email me: andy@greenrobot.com
